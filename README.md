"Rolled" is my initial Unity project, created to grasp the basics of game development. With three levels of increasing difficulty, players guide a ball forward while dodging obstacles. Using just the A and D keys, they strafe left and right. This project reflects my early steps into Unity, showcasing my commitment to learning and improving as a game developer.
